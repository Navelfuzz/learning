# Python Crash Course

## Purpose

This file is an abridged version of the textbook table of contents.

*Note: So far (it's been a long distance.. clearly I'm already an expert after Ch. 2) Syntax is much
different to C++, Java, and JavaScript but the operation and use of variables, data types, and built in
methods is not worth wasting too much time on.*

That said, don't ignore everything that may seem simple.
